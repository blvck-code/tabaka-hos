            The first two years of TMH Collegeâ€™s traditional Diploma program consist of general education courses that
            provide the liberal arts framework for the more advanced portions of the program. In the upper division
            nursing courses, students undertake a rigorous schedule with about 20 hours of in-class time per week.

            To deliver the highest-quality education, we use tools like case studies, presentations, Assessment
            Technologies Institute (ATI) resources, and other creative teaching approaches. On earning your diploma, you
